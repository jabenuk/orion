# Orion Library Documentation

This branch is a copy of the HTML documentation build output for hosting with GitHub pages or another
web service.

While I aim to keep this branch as up-to-date as possible, it is still recommended that you build the
documentation when building Orion with the `-DORION_BUILD_DOCS=ON` flag. **This is already on by
default.**
