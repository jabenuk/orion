 * @defgroup window GLFW Windowing System Abstractions for Orion
 * @brief Functionality related to the Orion abstractions of the GLFW library
 * @details Using this abstracted window system is @b not @b required, but it is recommended so that oriTerminate() can automatically free your window(s) and terminate GLFW.
 * GLFW will be @b implicitly @b initialised on the first Orion-abstracted function call.
 * <br><br>
 * Any undocumented functions in this section are simply abstractions of GLFW functions. For documentation on those functions, see GLFW's window reference (linked below)
 * and look for the function of the same name (just replace @c ori with @c glfw in the function name).
 *

 *
 * @todo The following functions are yet to be abstracted:
 *  - @c glfwSetWindowIcon()
 *  - @c glfwGetWindowMonitor()
 *  - @c glfwSetWindowMonitor()
